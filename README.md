## Summary 
This project was created to keep track of a player's performance statistics during a tennis match. This is a project that I am still working on. It is a side project that I began to develop to familiarize myself with frontend development.
In its current version, an observer is able to keep track of a player's performance during a match,
and then, view a statistical breakdown of that player. I have certain components and 
features present in this version that involve saving a match and viewing previous matches.
These features are not yet hooked up to an API, but I intend to make them functional
in later versions.
